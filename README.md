### Instructions
* log as many characters from The Simpsons as you can think of
* log how many you were able to remember
* that's it!

### Requirements
* node version 8.x
* npm version 5.x

Install node and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Check if you have the correct versions by running the following commands in your terminal:
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```

### Setup

Install the [React Devtools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) to easily debug and see what's going on in your React app.

Your text editor may not natively support the JSX syntax that is used in this project, but there may be plugins to get proper syntax highlighting. For example, Sublime Text uses the `Babel` plugin.

Then, clone this repository (click the green button saying "Clone or Download", choose http, and copy and paste it the location `<url>` ) and go into it:

```
$ git clone <url>
$ cd simpsons-memory-challenge
```

Install project dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

After that's done, run this to start development:
```
yarn start
```

This will start running the app and automatically open it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Anytime you change and save the code, it will automatically reload! This will remain a running process in your terminal, so you will need to open a new tab or window to execute other commands.

### Optional Setup
Prettier is a tool that automatically reformats your code to follow a certain set of coding style guidelines. It is configured to run automatically before each commit. This makes sure all of our code follows the same code styles, enforcing good practices and minimizing conflicts.

There are prettier plugins you can install for your editor. See instructions [here](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#editor-integration).
